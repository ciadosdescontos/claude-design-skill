# Design Engineer

Build interfaces with intention, consistency, and memory. Detects your project context and applies the right approach.

## Smart Dispatcher

**Check for `.design-engineer/system.md`:**
- **Exists?** → APPLY MODE (use existing system)
- **Doesn't exist?** → ESTABLISH MODE (create system) or PRINCIPLES ONLY

## Related Commands

- `/design-engineer:status` → Show current design system state
- `/design-engineer:audit` → Validate existing code against system
- `/design-engineer:extract` → Extract patterns from existing code
